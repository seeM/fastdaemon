**NB: fastdaemon is experimental. Use it at your own risk!**

## Install

fastdaemon isn’t hosted on PyPI yet, but you can install it directly
from GitHub:

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/seem/fastdaemon.git
```

## How to use

Although fastdaemon is still under development, you can use it to run
`nbprocess`’s git hooks. First start a server wrapping
`nbprocess_clean`. **Beware** - it is not considered stable and you
could lose your work!

``` sh
python serve_nbprocess_clean.py
```

Then update your `.gitconfig` as follows:

    [filter "clean-nbs"]
            clean = python client.py 9998 -- --stdin
            smudge = cat
            required = true
    [diff "ipynb"]
            textconv = python client.py 9998 --disp --fname
